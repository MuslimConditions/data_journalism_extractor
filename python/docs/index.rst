Welcome to Data Journalism Extractor's documentation!
=====================================================

This project is an attempt to create a tool to help journalists extract and process
data at scale, from multiple **heterogenous data sources** while leveraging
powerful and complex **database**, **information extraction** and **NLP** tools with
**limited programming knowledge**.

Features
--------

* Extract data from **relational databases** (Postgres, MySQL, Oracle), **NoSQL** databases 
  (MongoDB), CSV files, HDFS, etc.
* Use complex processing tools such as **soft string-matching functions**, **link extractions**, etc.
* Store outputs in multiple different data sinks (CSV files, databases, HDFS, etc.)
